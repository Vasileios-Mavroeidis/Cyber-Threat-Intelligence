## Sector/Industry Taxonomy for Cyber Threat Intelligence

The sector/industry taxonomy aims to be used by the cybersecurity community. It is an effort to produce a standard taxonomy for enriching threat information and support unambiguous information sharing. Producing, sharing, processing, and analyzing cyber threat intelligence requires using/adopting robust vocabularies and/or taxonomies to describe what we know unambiguously.

Even though standards-based classification systems or taxonomies exist for enumerating sectors and industries, they have been created based on geographical boundaries and different criteria, such as similar production processes, similar products, or similar behavior in financial markets.

This taxonomy does not reinvent the wheel, but it has been created by referencing numerous other known standards-based works and also efforts and material by the cybersecurity community. The taxonomy is not exhaustive because it should not be chaotic to utilize, but includes commonly seen targeted industries and sectors in the cyber domain.

The taxonomy comes together with descriptions that allow reliable classification, saving analysts time in the decision-making process. Also, a mapping table is provided to facilitate necessary interoperability, and support adoption since historical information can still be correlated and easily updated using the updated cybersecurity sector/industry taxonomy.

The taxonomy should be extended based on the requirements and needs of the cybersecurity community.

The emergency services sector includes geographically distributed facilities and equipment in both paid and volunteer capacities organized primarily at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels of government, such as city police departments and fire stations, county sheriffâ€™s offices, Department of Defense police and fire departments, and town public works departments. The emergency services sector also includes private sector resources, such as industrial fire departments, private security organizations, and private emergency medical services providers.

**Energy:** the energy sector/industry comprises entities involved in electricity generation and distribution, such as energy generation infrastructure (e.g., power plants), operators (e.g., grid operators), transmission and distribution lines, and utility providers. Electricity can be generated from renewable resources (e.g., hydro, wind, solar, biomass, geothermal), fossil fuels (such as coal and gas), or nuclear power.

Subclasses (sector/industry): **non-renewable-energy**, **renewable-energy**

**Non-renewable energy:** the non-renewable energy sector/industry comprises entities involved in electricity generation and distribution from non-renewable resources such as oil and petroleum products, gasoline, natural gas, diesel fuel, and nuclear.

It includes all foods, chemicals, textiles, machines, and equipment, it includes all refined metals and minerals derived from extracted ores, and it includes all lumber, wood, and pulp products. As a best practice, the manufacturing sector/industry element SHOULD be used when none of the taxonomy elements is adequate for tagging or classifying a case. In addition, like the rest of the elements, manufacturing can be used in combination with another element to provide extra precision in classification/tagging. For example, an incident that affects a company in the automotive sector/industry can be tagged as both automotive and manufacturing to indicate that the manufacturing process or a manufacturing plant was targeted.

**Maritime:** the maritime sector/industry involves a plethora of organizations and activities related to the ocean and ships and other floating entities. Examples are maritime transportation, shipyards, maritime equipment manufacturers, and commercial fishing. The maritime sector/industry highly overlaps with the transportation sector/industry.

**Non-profit:** the non-profit sector/industry comprises entities organized and operated for a collective, public, or social benefit compared to for-profit organizations that aim to generate a profit. The non-profit sector/industry may overlap with other sectors/industries that also accommodate non-profit entities, like public universities that are part of the education sector/industry, but they have a non-profit cause. Further, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are not distinguished and thus are included in the non-profit sector/industry.

Subclasses (sector/industry): **humanitarian aid**, **research**

**Humanitarian aid:** the humanitarian aid industry or humanitarian aid organizations provide material and logistic assistance to people who need help (e.g., homeless, refugees, and victims of natural disasters, wars, and famines).

**Research:** entities that solely specialize in research like research institutions and think tanks.

**Nuclear:** the nuclear sector/industry includes nuclear infrastructure, and in this taxonomy, it is unrelated to how the nuclear power is used, such as for energy generation, radioactive materials for healthcare, or for developing nuclear weapons. 

**Petroleum:** the petroleum sector/industry, also known as the oil sector/industry or the oil and gas sector/industry, includes the global processes of exploration, extraction, refining, and transporting (often by oil tankers and pipelines) petroleum. The petroleum industry overlaps with the chemical sector/industry in the sense that many finished products derive from petrochemical processing.

**Pharmaceutical:** the pharmaceutical sector/industry comprises entities that research, develop, produce, and distribute pharmaceutical products like medications. 

**Transportation:** the transportation sector/industry comprises services to move people or goods, and transportation infrastructure. The transportation sector consists of several industries that have focus on transportation, including air freight and logistics, airlines, marine, road and rail, and transportation infrastructures like railroads and marine ports.
